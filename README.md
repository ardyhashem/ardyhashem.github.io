# Jekyll one-page theme for professional profile

Drop the files into your repo:
- _layouts/default.html
- assets/css/main.css
- assets/js/main.js
- assets/js/analytics.js
- index.md
- _config.yml

Add images in `assets/img`.

Run locally:
1. Install Jekyll (see https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
2. In the repo root: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
3. Open http://127.0.0.1:4000

Notes:
- The page content is driven entirely by the YAML front matter in `index.md`.
- Edit text, lists and add/remove certifications by editing the front matter arrays.
- Layout preserves the original look & feel; any further styling tweaks should go to `assets/css/main.css`.
